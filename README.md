RNG Battle
Each team starts at 100 soldiers
Each soldier rolls one die
The team that rolls higher wins the fight and stays alive for the
	next fight
The team that looses the fight loses one soldier
The fight continues until one team is out of lives

WAYS TO MAKE IT MORE INTERESTING
THE TEAM THAT LOOSES
May get X more soliders based on consecutive losses
Gets X ammount of soldiers whoes die is 1-7 or 1-8 or somehow greater


THE TEAM THAT WINS
Gets X ammount of soldier whoes die is 1-5 or 1-4 or somehow lesser


PROGRAM IDEAS
There should be a way to have memory of previous battles so we can pick
	up anywhere in the previous battles
There could be more than 2 teams and they can decide on what strategy 
	they want to like who to attack
Once buffs or debuffs like the better die or worse die the teams can decide
	when they want to use them.

HOW DOES THE BATTLES WORK
A roll off happens and the team that wins decides which soldier to use first
The team that looses a fight decides which soldier to use next.
